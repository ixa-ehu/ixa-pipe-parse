Many thanks to David Magerman for allowing me to distribute his table.

Hi all.  Mike and Robert asked me for the Tree Head Table, so I
thought I'd pass it along to everyone in one shot.  Feel free to
distribute it to whomever at Penn wants it.

Note that it's not complete, and that I've invented a tag (% for the
symbol %) and a label (NP$ for NP's that end in POS).  I also have
some optional mapping mechanisms that: (a) convert to_TO -> to_IN when
in a prepositional phrase and (b) translate (PRT x_RP) -> (ADVP x_RB),
thus mapping away the distinction between particles and adverbs.  I
currently use transformation (b) in my parser, but don't use (a).
These facts may or may not be relevant, depending on how you want to
use this table.

Cheers,
-- David

Tree Head Table
---------------

Instructions:

1. The first column is the non-terminal.  The second column indicates
where you start when you are looking for a head (left is for
head-initial categories, right is for head-final categories).  The
rest of the line is a list of non-terminal and pre-terminal categories
which represent the head rule.

2. ** is a wildcard value.  Any non-terminal with ** in its rule means
that anything can be its head.  So, for a head-initial category, **
means the first word is always the head, and for a head-final
category, ** means the last word is always the head.  In most cases,
** means I didn't investigate good head rules for that category, so it
might be worthwhile to do so yourself.

3. The Tree Head Table is used as follows:

	a. Use tree head rule based on NT category of constituent
	b. For each category X in tree head rule, scan the children of
           the constituent for the first (or last, for head-final)
           occurrence of category X.  If
           X occurs, that child is the head.
        c. If no child matches any category in the list, use the first
           (or last, for head-final) child as the head.

4. I treat the NP category as a special case.  Before consulting the
head rule for NP, I look for the rightmost child with a label
beginning with the letter N.  If one exists, I use that child as the
head.  If no child's tag begins with N, I use the tree head rule.

Here's the head table which I used in my experiments below. The first column
is just the number of fields on that line. Otherwise, the format is the same
as David's.

Ignore the row for NPs -- I use a special set of rules for this. For these
I initially remove ADJPs, QPs, and also NPs which dominate a possesive
(tagged POS, e.g.  (NP (NP the man 's) telescope ) becomes
(NP the man 's telescope)). These are recovered as a post-processing stage
after parsing. The following rules are then used to recover the NP head:

If the last word is tagged POS, return (last-word);

Else search from right to left for the first child which is an NN, NNP, NNPS, NNS, NX, POS, or JJR

Else search from left to right for first child which is an NP

Else search from right to left for the first child which is a $, ADJP or PRN

Else search from right to left for the first child which is a CD

Else search from right to left for the first child which is a JJ, JJS, RB or QP

Else return the last word
